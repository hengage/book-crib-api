# Book Crib API 
[https://booksbackendapi.herokuapp.com/api/](https://booksbackendapi.herokuapp.com/api/)

Web application for books

### Features: 
- create and update user
- add and update book details

Clone repo \
`git clone https://github.com/hengage/book-crib-api.git`

I used a venv for virtuel env. So just run the following
`python -m venv venv`

Afterwards, activate virtuel environment

Install all packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

For the api schema documentation,  [ drf-yasg](https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg) was used

#### Going forward, i would improve this project and add some features like so:
- delete author and book
- add book by an author dynamically
- login and logout auth system
- share book detail via link
